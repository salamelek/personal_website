                            This was a long-term project that is still not yet finished. It started back in high school
                            as an HTML site, and now it's becoming a full PHP interactive site.

                            This project was born as an exercise for us, but it turned out more like an exercise for me.
                            Similar to this website, I had no idea about anything really. This project was my first learning
                            experience with HTML, CSS and JS. I used a python script to generate all the HTML pages from a
                            JSON files, which was a nightmare to edit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since v1 was unmanageable and I was learning about javascript, I decided to switch the python
                            script for a js one. I was also sick of copy-pasting everything, so I tried to use php just to use
                            the "include" command.<br>
                            It was a much better alternative than v1, but it never really worked properly. That's why I
                            started working on v3, but never actually finished it.<br>

                            >[V2 website]</a>,
                            <a
                                    href="https://github.com/salamelek/botanicni_vrt_2/"

                        <p>
                            The big thing about v3 is that it has its own MySQL database, and it all works with php on
                            my server. I wanted to make it in such a way that even when i+ll be gone from the school the
                            teachers could update any plant entries without messing around with weird JSON files. This
                            is why I created from scratch a whole system of users that can edit, add and delete plant
                            entries. I didn't use any frameworks, so I'm pretty sure that with some simple SQL injection
                            attacks the whole database would be gone, but my hope is that no one cares that much about a
                            random plant site.<br>

                            I never actually used this, but it was a fun project.
                            It uses a pair of secret and public key to generate the password for any account. The secret
                            key is the keyring password, while the public key is the name of the application of the account.
                            The program spews out a different password for every key pair with the help of hashing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the Python version worked fine, it was very inconvenient to use. That's why I made a
                            <a href="https://salamelek.rikis.net/password" class="visible-link">web version</a> and
                            later also the browser plugin version (I didn't bother putting it on the web store though).

                            From there I ordered som LED-lights, lipo batteries and some charging modules and threw all
                            together in a carved out rock to make an awesome mini lamp.

                            My dream of creating an RC submarine from scratch with an arduino, some motors and lots of
                            luck.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="show-more hidden">
                        <p>
                            The plan is to have a submarine controlled from my pc on land via an RF24 module for
                            arduino. I made a Python script that captures keyboard or joystick events and sends them
                            to an arduino nano via USB that in turn transmits via RF24 to the submarine antenna, where
                            a second arduino translates the packets and controls the submarine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like any other RC submarine, I can't just rely on wireless communication, since 2.4GhZ waves
                            barely penetrate water. My plan is to tether the sub to a floating antenna that will get all
                            the signals, while allowing the submarine all the wanted mobility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides the basic movement functions I also want to add an FPV camera, so I can see live
                            where it's going on my computer screen.
                        </p>

                            For now the project is stuck on the ballast design, but I think that eventually it will be
                            done.

                            reach financial freedom? <i>(probably not, but at least I'm learning new stuff)</i>

                        <p>
                            It all started back in 2018, when I made a rudimentary Python script that connected to a
                            broker's API and bought and sold crypto based on a questionable strategy found online in
                            about 5 minutes. As expected, it did not perform well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After some time I revisited the idea, but this time I wanted to implement it using AI. So
                            like any good programmer would do (sarcasm), I just jumped into programming without even
                            planning. I tried deep q-learning and KNN too, but soon I realised that it was a bit more
                            complicated than I thought.
